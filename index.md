# Geo Meets Climate Models Summer Internship

## Introduction

The scientific community now has access to an extensive archive of paleoclimate simulations, including experiments from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project ([PMIP](https://pmip.lsce.ipsl.fr/)), [PlioMIP](https://geology.er.usgs.gov/egpsc/prism/7_pliomip2.html), and [DeepMIP](https://www.deepmip.org/). These simulations offer incredible opportunities to explore past climate states and mechanisms. However, many geology graduate students lack the training to access and analyze climate model outputs, leaving a gap between paleoclimate data and model-based insights.

The **Geo Meets Climate Models Summer Internship** bridges this gap. Hosted by Dr. Natalie Burls at George Mason University, this four-week program is designed for U.S.-based geology graduate students generating and working with paleoclimate proxy data. Interns learn how to access and analyze climate model outputs, compare their data to simulations for key intervals such as the Last Millennium, Mid-Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, Last Interglacial, Mid-Pliocene Warm Period, and Eocene, and investigate climate mechanisms.

Through hands-on research and mentorship, participants gain practical skills in model-data comparison, empowering them to integrate climate simulations into their research and unlock new insights into Earth’s past.

The **Geo Meets Climate Models Summer Internship** took place across the summers of 2021 to 2023 in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Earth Sciences at George Mason University.
